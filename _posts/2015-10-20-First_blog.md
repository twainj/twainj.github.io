It has been awhile since I have considered starting a blog or two. I'm hoping it will be a good exercise to get back in the habit and craft of writing, and I'm choosing to create a development blog first, as it is the place I most often find I have something I could write about. 

So as most dev blogs are, this will be a place for me to record things I have found, so I can find them later, or point others to a more complete write-up. But I also hope to go more in depth as I try new technologies. And while this is primarily a blog on tech, there are several topics related to the *implications* of technology that I may put a voice to. And that might include thoughts on the business behind the tech I use.

I have a few notes stashed away on topics I want to put down, and they include things like:

* A Git recipe (transforming a Mercurial repo into SVN through Git - don't even ask why I ever had to do that)
* VCS workflow notes and some guidelines I follow
* A discussion on implementation complexity
* Some configuration management tasks using Node.js
* PhoneGap Build environment notes
* Some exploration on Logic Programming and Prolog (including some tutorial supplements to [Warren's Abstract Machine](http://www.amazon.com/Warrens-Abstract-Machine-Reconstruction-Programming/dp/0262510588)


So that, and brief notes following my day-to-day work, is what (I hope) you can expect to see from here!

Stay tuned!
