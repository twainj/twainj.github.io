Would love to build a system that supports a pi zero that can be used for potentially many things, but mostly camera that can be worn on hat, and activated, bluetooth, through phone (app?)



Parts that might be helpful:

MoPi: powers Pi from multiple sources, at once, could include battery, solar, etc.

Lipo Battery power supply shim - might be good for battery-only power sourcing

Lithium-Polymer batteries - good size and power for mobile devicing - also compatible with the adafruit charger below

Solar cells - lots of sizes at reasonable prices - not sure if they meet requirements yet.

Solar battery charger board - would work as a separate system for charging batteries.
