This post is about finding the actual functional differences between PhoneGap and Cordova.

A brief link farm to point people to the conceptual differences - maybe yet another quote of the ionic blog - but then to business.

The trick will be finding the actual code between the two.  Sintaxi/PhoneGap on GitHub seems to be the starting place for the PhoneGap code - it has the Android, iOS, and Windows platforms. The PhoneGap/PhoneGap repo seems to be truncated - have yet to figure out what that means.
The Cordova code seems to be in different repos per platform on the Apache Git site (they are all mirrored to GitHub). So a start might be comparing the Android folder/repo between the two.
