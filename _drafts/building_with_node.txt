Building with Node on windows is more painful than it really should be.

This is often because of node-gyp, which is a bit painful to use.

I use Chocolatey, so this uses chocolatey to install all of the things that are necessary.
You'll have to check the readme file for exact build instructions, but usually, it is something along the lines of:

```
git clone http://github/some-users/awesome-project
cd awesome-project
npm install
npm run build
```

I'm trying to build the Kendo Open Source package for a specific version, so I'll use that as an example. It looks like they include the install process in the build script.

First, of course, we need node/npm. It never hurts to use the most stable current version of Node.
```
choco install nodejs-lts -y
```


You may get errors about Python - saying that they can't find the executable, and suggesting that you set the PYTHON environment variable. This could be a bit of a goose chase. You specifically need Python 2 for node-gyp and the errors won't necessarily clue you in that you have the wrong version. If you install the correct version, you shouldn't need to set a path:
```
choco install python2
```

I saw an error that the windows SDK could not be found, so after a bit of searching, I had to install it. You may need the version for Windows 10, but mine specifically asked for Windows 8.1, so that's what I install:

```
choco install windows-sdk-8.1 -y
```

Another error (need to check what it was), because I had VS 2015 Community installed. So this was necessary. Note that even though the install script is built into the build script, in order to use this flag, I need to install explicitly.

```
npm install --msvs_version=2015
